# Crypto ETF

## How to use
- The code outputs a dataframe of the top 20 largest cryptocurrencies, their corresponding weights, and the timestamp.
- You need to create a free coinmarketcap developer account and obtain the API key [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/).
- This code can be run as often as you need to rebalance your portfolio. For example, if you rebalance the ETF every month you would:
1. Run the code at the start of the month
2. Compare your current portfolio weights
3. Rebalance the portfolio on your crypto exchange as needed

## TO-DO
